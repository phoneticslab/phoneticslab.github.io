We meet weekly as a group during term time, with a mix of invited speakers and internal talks. We also host occasional workshops and schedule a lab social at least once per term.

Details of all talks and events are publicised via our mailing list. Lancaster staff and students can add themselves to the phonetics mailing list as follows:

1. Log in to [LU Mailing Lists](http://lists.lancs.ac.uk) (you may need to use VPN if off-campus)
2. Click “Public Lists” at the top of the screen and search “phonetics"
3. Click the link to the “phonetics” mailing list and click “join”
4. A welcome message will appear in the browser window. Click “Continue” - you will now be subscribed to the list.

We also have a Microsoft Teams group for more general chat and discussion - please contact [Sam Kirkham](mailto:s.kirkham@lancaster.ac.uk) to be added to the group.
