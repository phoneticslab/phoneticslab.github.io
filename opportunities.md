If you are a junior academic with existing research funding and you might be interested in working with us then please get in touch.

# PhD positions

Occasionally we have funded PhD projects available, which will be listed above. For more information about studying at Lancaster please see [here](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/phd/). It is highly advisable to contact a relevant member of academic staff from our group if you are interested in applying, as we need to make sure we have availability and that your project fits our interests.

You can find information about applying for funding [here](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/phd/scholarship-and-funding-opportunities/). Most of these schemes are open to UK and international students, but please check the guidelines of each scheme for more details. If you want to apply for funding then we would definitely recommend getting in touch well in advance of the application date.

# Visiting researchers

We offer separate schemes for visiting students and visiting academics.

You can see the official application information above, but do feel free to get in touch with a member of staff from the group for an informal chat beforehand to assess whether you would be a good fit and that we'd be able to support your visit.


# Student interns and assistantships

We regularly have funding for term-time and summer student internships, mainly for Lancaster University students. If you are a non-Lancaster student and wish to consider summer research please get in touch with a member of academic staff from the group. Note that we don't offer any unfunded research assistant positions - we believe you should be paid for your work!
