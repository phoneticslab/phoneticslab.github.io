# Current projects

Our research spans a large number of projects across diverse areas - it would be too difficult to keep an up-to-date list! You can get a good idea of what people are working on by looking at the lab's member pages linked [here](people.md). Some recent and current funded projects include:

* Modelling the dynamics of phonetic and phonological variation (AHRC)
* Vocal effort, nasal coarticulation & individual variability (IAFPA)
* Resonance as a phonetic resource in language cognition (SPARC)
* Changing /r/ accents? (Leverhulme Trust)
* Identifying speakers who speak an unfamiliar language (British Academy)
